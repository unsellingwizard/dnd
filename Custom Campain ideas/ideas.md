Session 1 starting point idea

{The three of you awaken in a completely black empty void before
reality starts forming around you suddenly there's a chair under you and then
there are people in groups of three people each one clearly going through the same thing as you then wood paneling
unfolds and creates a wall and then a ceiling and then wood planks unfold like
origami to create a stage and on that stage appears a woman standing with a
stature of authority in academic robes she's clearly the Dean to the college
that the three of you each applied to player one for his reasons player 2 for
theirs player 3 for their own reasons as well.

“welcome to the (name of town) University for heroes and
villains, I (to be named) would like to welcome you all to your first semester of
course that means starting off with a test one that will determine the next four
or for some of you eight years of University now for some of you that means
burying your faces deep into tomes and learning the darkest of magics for
others that means practicing on Enchanted skeletons in the test dungeon or
maybe even learning how to tell the best lies in our very own underground
Tavern But before all that let's see where each lab party places”

once the Dean finishes her speech she waves her hand and the
entire auditorium refolds itself like an intricate origami separating each of
the parties of three and then around you unfolds another room made of similar
wood paneling and in your heads you hear her voice

“this is your exam get out of this room 1st and you become top
the class get to this room last and you become bottom of the class” }
