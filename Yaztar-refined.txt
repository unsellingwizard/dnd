Being born in the underdark, well for someone thats both male and only half drow there really are no words that can describe it.
For the most part at least when I was young I was able to be kept hidden in a closet with a book, that's when I learned the basics of magic.
At least the technical aspects of it since I possesed no natural aptitude twoards casting.
As I got older I was less able to be hidden and one day was caught, and everything became pain, I was turned into a pain slave for the use of entertainment.
One day I got a chance to escape and I took it, and ran as far and fast as I could untill I found a crack in the cavern walls that lead me through into a small tight alcove.
Contained with in was a crystal about the size of my palm, purple in color with white star like specs suspened within.
Apon looking at it, it seemed to consume all my attention and draw me twoards touching it.
When I did everything went purple, glowing purple jagged tendral like markings grew up the left side of my hand from where I touched the crystal up to my eye, both eyes started glowing purple.
And as I held on to the crystal my head filled with voices which began to overwhelm me.
Then everything went dark, when I woke up I was in Mirabar.
I may not truly ever find out why this crystal I wear around my neck was down there, could it have been a god reaching out to me tying to help or looking to help themselves and I have just become another pawn in their games.
Since I woke up I've been hearing voices like the ones that I heard when I first touched the stone, their bareable like constant background chatter that you cant quite make out what is being said.
Though I dont know common that well I can catch the meaning most of the time of what people are saying around me, the people around here seem nice enough most of the them I have learned are humans and dwarfs
